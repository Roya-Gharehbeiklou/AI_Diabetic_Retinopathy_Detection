# Retinopathy Detection using ResNet Architectures

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting and classifying retinopathy using advanced deep learning techniques. Leveraging pre-trained ResNet models, the project builds a robust solution for medical image analysis, particularly for diagnosing retinopathy from retinal images.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Models**: Utilizes ResNet architectures (including ResNet50 and Inception-ResNet) for feature extraction and classification.
- **Transfer Learning**: Employs pre-trained models for enhanced performance on smaller datasets.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Implements robust image preprocessing pipelines to prepare data for training and evaluation.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.

## Technologies and Libraries

This project uses the following libraries:

- **TensorFlow** and **Keras**: For deep learning and model development.
- **NumPy** and **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For visualizing data and model performance.
- **scikit-learn**: For metrics and cross-validation.
- **PIL**: For image processing.


## Future Work

- Extend to other medical image classification tasks.
- Optimize model performance using advanced techniques like ensemble learning.
